## Traits

### **_Second Wind._**

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### **_Improved Critical._**

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

### **_Action Surge._**

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### **_Sentry's Rest.._**

When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn’t render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.

### **_Warforged Resilience._**

You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits.

- You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You are immune to disease.
- You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You don't need to sleep and don't suffer the effects of exhaustion due to lack of rest, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

### **_[Combat Beast Shapes.](./Wild%20Shapes.md)_**

You spent an extended amount of time with druids and you have gained the ability to rearrange your shape into different beast shapes. Allowing you to change your movements and attacks to fit the situation. See other file for options, you can also ask about other shapes if you want.

### **_[Rune Warrior](./Runes.md)_**

you can carve 2 different runes into your rocks on a daily basis and use those runes as a bonus action on your turn

### **_Giant's Might_**

At 3rd level, you have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:

- If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.
- You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
