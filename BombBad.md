# Bomb Bag of Holding

"An upgrade to a standard Bag of Holding, this modified version has been enchanted to safely store and deploy explosive devices. Developed by an eccentric goblin demolitions expert with more arcane curiosity than concern for safety."

---

### Item Type:

Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)

### Core Features:

Bomb Deployment (Action)
As an action, the user can reach into the bag and pull out a bomb to throw.

_Range:_ 30 ft (normal) / 60 ft (disadvantage)
_Explosion Radius:_ 10 ft
_Save:_ DC 13 Dexterity
_Damage:_ 2d6 fire damage on fail, half on success
_Limit:_ 3 bombs per long rest (recharges magically)

Bombs cannot be duplicated with magic or used by a Bag of Holding trick (like flipping it inside out).

## Bomb Types (Optional Variety)

Instead of standard bombs, the user may choose a bomb type when pulling one out (once unlocked):

Bomb Type Effect
_Standard Bomb_ 2d6 fire in 10-ft radius (default)
_Smoke Bomb_ Creates a 20-ft-radius heavily obscured cloud for 1 minute
_Flash Bomb_ Targets in 10 ft must succeed on DC 13 Con save or be blinded until the end of their next turn
_Sticky Bomb_ On hit, it sticks to the target and explodes next turn, dealing 3d6 fire to them and anyone within 5 ft (no save)

Unlocked via DM discretion (e.g., quest, crafting, leveling).

## Limitations

Only the attuned user can retrieve bombs.

The bag prevents chain-reactionsâ€”explosives inside are magically stabilized.

Attempting to overfill or "break" the 3-use limit causes a mini explosion (2d4 force damage to the user).

The bag can't store other volatile or magical items (like spell scrolls or potions) without risk (DM call).

## Usage Ideas

Toss a flash bomb before a stealth move.

Drop a sticky bomb from a ledge above a guard.

Use a smoke bomb to cover retreat.

Trick enemies by pretending to pull a potion but throw a bomb.
